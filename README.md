# Changelog Linker

[![Downloads](https://img.shields.io/packagist/dt/symplify/changelog-linker.svg?style=flat-square)](https://packagist.org/packages/symplify/changelog-linker/stats)

Turn your `CHANGELOG.md` from a machine readable text to a **rich text that makes every programmer happy**.

## Install

```bash
composer require symplify/changelog-linker --dev
```

## Usage

Create `changelog-linker.yaml` with configuration:

```yaml
parameters:
    # this is detected from "git origin", but you can change it
    repository_url: 'https://github.com/symplify/symplify'
```

The config is autodiscovered in the root directory or by `--config` option.

## A. Dump Merges

```bash
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges
```

### Write or Dry-run?

The `--dry-run` option prints the result to the output. Without that, I looks for `<!-- changelog-linker -->` in the `CHANGELOG.md` to replace with the content.

It finds the last #ID in the `CHANGELOG.md`, than looks on Github via API and dumps all the merged PRs since the last #ID in nice format. In case you want to **specify minimal PR id yourself**, use this:

```bash
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges --since-id 125
```

But that is a mash-up of everything. Not very nice:

```markdown
## Unreleased

- [#868] [ChangelogLinker] Add ChangeTree to manage merge messages
- [#867] [ChangelogLinker] Change Worker registration from implicit to explicit
- [#865] Improve Code Complexity
- [#864] [MonorepoBuilder] improve coverage
```

What if we'd have *Added*, *Changed*... all the standard categories?

```
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges --in-categories
```

↓

```markdown
## Unreleased

### Added

- [#828] [ChangelogLinker] Add Unreleased to last tagged version feature
- [#840] [ChangelogLinker] Add LinkifyWorker
```

Nice, now everything is nicely grouped.

*(Do you want to know how we detect the category? [Follow me](https://github.com/symplify/symplify/blob/master/packages/changelog-linker/src/ChangeTree/Resolver/CategoryResolver.php))*

What about packages - can we have group them as well? Sure:

```
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges --in-packages
```

↓

```markdown
## Unreleased

### CodingStandard

- [#851] Add _ support to PropertyNameMatchingTypeFixer
- [#860] Add test case for #855, Thanks to @OndraM
```

*(Technical secret: it reacts to *[Package]* in PR title.)*

Let's take it one step further!

```
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges --in-packages --in-categories
```

↓

```markdown
## Unreleased

### CodingStandard

#### Added

- [#851] Add _ support to PropertyNameMatchingTypeFixer
- [#860] Add test case for #855, Thanks to @OndraM
```

Do you prefer categories first? Just switch the order:

```
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges --in-categories --in-packages
```

↓

```markdown
## Unreleased

### Added

#### EasyCodingStandard

- [#851] Add _ support to PropertyNameMatchingTypeFixer
- [#860] Add test case for #855, Thanks to @OndraM
```

Do you want to dump only such pull requests that were merged into a particular branch? Just use `base-branch` option:

```
vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges --base-branch=7.3
```
This is very handy when you support multiple versions of your project.

### Github API Overload?

In case you cross the API rate limit and get denied, create [new Github Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens) and run it via `GITHUB_TOKEN` ENV variable.

```
GITHUB_TOKEN super-secret-token vendor/bin/changelog-linker dump-merges
```

## B. Decorate `CHANGELOG.md`

```bash
vendor/bin/changelog-linker link
```

### 1. Link PR and Issues

```diff
 ### Added

-- #123 Cool new without detailed description wanting me to see PR, [closes #234]
+- [#123] Cool new without detailed description wanting me to see PR, [closes [#234]]
+
+[#123]: https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/123
+[#234]: https://github.com/symplify/symplify/pull/234
```

### 2. Link Versions to Diffs

```diff
-## v2.0.0 - 2017-12-31
+## [v2.0.0] - 2017-12-31

 - ...

 ## v1.5.0 - 2017-06-30
+
+[v2.0.0]: https://github.com/symplify/symplify/compare/v1.5.0...v2.0.0
```

### 3. Can I Thank My Contributors?

Of course! Give your contributors credit they deserve:

```diff
 ### [v2.0.0] - 2017-12-31

-- ... thanks @SpacePossum for help
+- ... thanks [@SpacePossum] for help
+
+[@SpacePossum]: https://github.com/SpacePossum
```

You can exclude core maintainers, to give external contributors more credit:

```yaml
# changelog-linker.yaml
parameters:
    authors_to_ignore: ['TomasVotruba']
```

### 4. How to Link Specific Words?

In Symplify, I need that every `EasyCodingStandard` word leads to `https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard/`.

```yaml
# changelog-linker.yaml
parameters:
    names_to_urls:
        EasyCodingStandard: 'https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard/'
```

```diff
 ## Unreleased

 ### Added

-#### EasyCodingStandard
+#### [EasyCodingStandard]
+
+[EasyCodingStandard]: https://github.com/symplify/easy-coding-standard/
```

### 5. Can I Write Shorter PR Titles?

![ECS-Run](docs/alias.png)

Just add alias to config:

```yaml
# changelog-linker.yaml
parameters:
    package_aliases:
        CS: 'CodingStandard'
```

...and it will be resolved to `CodingStandard` package.
